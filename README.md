# Blinkit-_sales
This project visualizes sales and item for Blinkit_ India last Minute App using power bi and raw data
I have thoroughly cleaned the Blinkit sales data by identifying and resolving inconsistencies, correcting missing or duplicate entries, and standardizing formats to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This data cleaning process has resulted in a more structured and error-free dataset, ready for in-depth analysis. Following the cleanup, I created a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that visually represents key performance indicators (KPIs), such as sales trends, product performance, and regional metrics. The dashboard offers easy-to-understand visualizations, providing valuable insights for decision-making and performance tracking. This solution is designed to enhance business intelligence and support data-driven strategies for Blinkit's sales team.
